Synopsis:
A VR game that places the user in a small room with different masks on the wall. As the user swaps masks they are teleported to different rooms. This was a small prototype made for a game jam in October of 2020. 

Purpose:
Understand the Unity XR Interactive Toolkit
Develop a way to give the user wearable items in VR
Create an accurate mirror and have the users actions reflected in them
Have the environment change when a mask was put on
